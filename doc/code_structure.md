## Domain decomposition

For the moment, miniPIC does not support distributed memory parallelism.

The domain is decomposed into patches using a 3D cartesian decomposition. Each patch is designed to be independent and can be computed in parallel. It represents a piece of the domain that contains the particles and the local current field grid.

Maxwell's equations are solved at the domain scale.
Therefore, electromagnetic fields grids are global.
A reduction operation is performed to compute the global current grid from the local current grids.

## Code design

The figure below illustrates schematically the code design. It shows how the different classes are organized and how they interact with each other.

Each file provides either a set of functions, a namespace or a data container (class).
