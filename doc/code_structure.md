## Domain decomposition

MiniPIC does not support distributed memory parallelism and contains a single domain.

## Code design

The figure below illustrates schematically the code design. It shows how the different classes are organized and how they interact with each other.

Each file provides either a set of functions, a namespace or a data container (class).

| File              | Where                 | Description                                                                      |

| Main              | `src`                 | Main source file for the global code structure                                   |
| Managers          | Implementation folder | Free functions called by the subdomain manager, to call the operators            |
